# Dutch-cities-fetcher
A web scraper fetching data such as cooridinates and postal provinces of Dutch cities. These data were fetched from a search API of MediaWiki, whose complete information can be found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).   
The work is of personal interest, but the result produced by this script is used for the project in an Applied Data Science course I attended while being an exchange student in Fontys University of Applied Data Sciences, Netherlands.
The script works when the path to a list of city names is input.
